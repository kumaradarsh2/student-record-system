-- Core Features of the Project

Basic Functionalities:

1. Add a Student
    Name
    Roll Number (unique id)
    Age/Class
    Marks/Grade

2. View all students
3. Search a student by roll number or name
4. Delete a student
5. Update a student record (optional)
6. Save data to a file (so it's not lost)
7. Load data from a file on startup (eventually)

Data example

Name: Adarsh Kumar  
Roll: 101 
Age: 18  
Class: 12th  
Maths: 85  
Science: 91  
English: 78

<!-- All about class -->
// What is class?
It's a user-defined data type which holds its own data members and member functions. 
Which can be accessed by creating instance of class which is known as object.
Class is like blueprint for an object.

// Making a list to store the students


<!-- Now we gonna learn about file handling in c++ -->

// What is file handling?
File handling is used to store data permanently into the secondary memory (hard disk)

For achieving File Handling we need to do these steps:

 STEP 1-Naming a file
 STEP 2-Opening a file
 STEP 3-Writing data into the file
 STEP 4-Reading data from the file
 STEP 5-Closing a file.


// Streams in c++:


// Loop logic used to run the program over and over again unless the user exits 
LOOP:
    1. Show menu
    2. Get user input
    3. Call function
    4. Pause so user can read
    5. Repeat unless input was "exit"
